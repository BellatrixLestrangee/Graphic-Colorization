# Graphic-Colorization
Image colorization is the process of taking an input grayscale (black and white) image and then producing an output colorized image that represents the semantic colors and tones of the input (for example, an ocean on a clear sunny day must be plausibly “blue” — it can’t be colored “hot pink” by the model).

Previous methods for image colorization either:

   1. Relied on significant human interaction and annotation
   2.  Produced desaturated colorization

The novel approach we are going to use here today instead relies on deep learning. We will utilize a Convolutional Neural Network capable of colorizing black and white images with results that can even “fool” humans!

## Method To Use File 
1. The first half of the Colab Notebook file is pertaining image colorization and the second half is for Video Colorization. 
You may download the code and modify parameters to input image and video accordingly. 
2. For the prototxt file, caffe model and points in hull file, follow the link given at the end of this document. 
3. A few sample images are in the input file. Feel free to use them or use your own. 
4. The code pertaining to code can also handle video stream.
